# Contributing to Pixiq

Oh yes, you can contribute! No matter what you do, we will be very grateful :)

**Pixiq is very young project, so by contributing you can have a great impact of how it will be designed and implemented**.

Some ways to contribute:
1. Help with resolving [issues](issues): comment, discuss, make Pull Request reviews, suggest changes, help with documentation and if you are ready make your own Pull Requests :) 
2. Play with API and suggest improvements based on your experience 
3. Create your very own libraries, abstractions and tools and leave a link to your project, so we can add 


For those who are really interested in serious Pixiq development here are some interesting documentation:
